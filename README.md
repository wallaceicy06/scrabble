Scrabble
========
Scrabble is a computer implementation of the popular word game to be used over a local area network. Multiple client
players connect to a master server that handles all move requests, scoring, and word verification. This was a joint
project between myself and Chris Miles as part of our AP Computer Science Class in 2011.

Running Instructions
-------
1. Execute main of ServerDriver and enter the number of clients you want to listen for.
2. Execute each instance of ClientDriver and enter the corresponding address of your server that you want to connect to.
3. Play Scrabble!
