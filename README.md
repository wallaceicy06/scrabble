Scrabble
========
Scrabble is a computer implementation of the popular word game to be used over a local area network. Multiple client
players connect to a master server that handles all move requests, scoring, and word verification. This was a joint
project between myself and Chris Miles as part of our AP Computer Science Class in 2011.
